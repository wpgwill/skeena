I didn&#8217;t do a heck of a lot on the first day I arrived in Jaipur, hence the first day being mostly a hotel review. I had booked a guided private tour for the next 3 days. The reasoning for this is mostly practical, the attractions in Jaipur are very spread out &#8211; and metered taxis aren&#8217;t commonly available. I didn&#8217;t want to tackle the bus system, so this seemed like the best option.

The first attraction was the Amber Fort / Amber palace, and this is probably one of Jaipur&#8217;s best known attractions.Â [<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-236" src="https://www.skeena.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0775-300x200.jpg" alt="IMG_0775" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.skeena.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0775-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.skeena.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0775-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.skeena.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0775-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.skeena.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0775.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](https://www.skeena.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0775.jpg)

The Amber palace is directly in front, with one of Jaipur&#8217;s forts being up on the hill. There was actually a tunnel built so the king could escape from his palace to the fort if there was an attack.

The top floor window of the above photo is where the Queen would wait for the King to return from battle. The Queen wasn&#8217;t allowed to circulate with the commoners, so she had a view of the courtyard from the second floor with a screen.

Given how dry Rajasthan is, most palaces and fort&#8217;s constructed artificial lakes to supply water. These lakes are filled by the monsoon rains, and hopefully provide enough water during the dry season. In the case of the Amber Palace, they also constructed a garden on the lake. Unfortunately you couldn&#8217;t get into the actual garden, but it was still pretty impressive from a distance.

Even though the building is hundreds of years old, this is the kind of details you can still find all over the walls.

Another interesting room in the palace, was the hall of mirrors, there are literally mirrors all over the walls and ceiling. Apparently it made an impressive light show in the evenings with candles.

The whole complex is very well preserved, and certainly worth visiting. India really does have some of the best historical attractions in the world.
