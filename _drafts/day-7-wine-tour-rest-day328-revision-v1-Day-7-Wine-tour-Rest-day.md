After travelling 337KM, it was time for a rest day. Since my B&B was located high above Kelowna, and I wanted a day without bike riding my only option to explore the area was a tour. My B&B recommended a couple wine tours that would pickup at my location. The only tour available was an all day wine tour, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure if doing a full day tour would be worth it but I decided to go for it.At 9AM the tour picked up at my B&B, and it turned out there was only one other British couple on the tour. I got along well with the tour guide and the Brits, so it made for a fun day touring around tasting wine.

By chance it turned out my tour guide had met Ian, one of the main characters out of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2204371/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">movie Somm</a> &#8211; a movie about people trying to obtain their Master Sommelier designation. If you&#8217;re interested in wine, the movie is well worth watching and I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s available on Netflix.

We ended up going to around 6 wineries, the ones I can remember are:

  * Blasted Church
  * Sumac Ridge
  * Stoneboat
  * Rustico Cellars

Because I am still riding to Vancouver, I couldn&#8217;t really by much in the way of wine. Despite that, I did get 2 unique half bottles of wine:

One is a wine hot sauce, made of Cabernet Franc that has a hot pepper in the bottle. It&#8217;s a nice mix of sweet and spicy &#8211; I&#8217;ve never seen something quite like it at a winery so I had to buy it. Stoneboat had excellent icewine that I couldn&#8217;t resist purchasing &#8211; it was one of the guides recommended suppliers of icewine in the region.

While in the south Okanagan near Oliver, we spotted a forest fire burning:

After an enjoyable tour, it was back to the B&B for dinner.
