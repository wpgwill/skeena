Everything seems more convenient in Japan sometimes, I got this from ANA (Japanese airline):

> <p class="p1">
>   Subject: From ANA [5 days prior to departure date]
> </p>
> 
> <p class="p1">
>   To passengers flying to/from Japan by ANA operated international flights
> </p>
> 
> <p class="p1">
>   Passengers who pre-register required information will be automatically checked in 24 hours prior to the departure time of the international flight, and will notify you with boarding pass information via e-mail.
> </p>

  Yes you don&#8217;t even have to checkin on the website, just fill in some basic information when you book and they simply email you a boarding pass 24 hours prior to departure! Looking forward to my first flight on ANA:
</p>

> <p class="p1">
>    Chicago(ORD) &#8211; Tokyo(Narita)
> </p>
> 
> <p class="p1">
>    DEP. 17:15  ARR.20:10 +1   Flight time: 12:55
> </p>
> 
> <p class="p1">
>    Seat number: 1K
> </p>
> 
> <p class="p1">
>    First class &#8211;  OK
> </p>
