The day started with an excellent breakfast with my hosts at the Frenchtown Inn, an excellent B&B located in St Charles a few blocks from the Katy Trail. They have only been open around a year, and I was there first Canadian guest. There were two other couples staying at the B&B, and both were from Missouri just on a local vacation.

You never really know if you like a bike until you&#8217;ve ridden it for a couple hours, so I was a bit nervous how the cyclocross bike would work out given the milage I was going to put in over the next 4 riding days. A road bike stance is actually much more comfortable for extended rides since your weight is balanced between your handlebars and seat compared with a typical hybrid or mountain bike. This can also cause issues with your back and neck though, but those issues usually aren&#8217;t apparent until you have been on the bike a while.

I ended up leaving around 9:30AM, and jumped on the trail right at St Charles station. The maintenance of the Katy trail is excellent, it&#8217;s in better shape overall than the city trails like the Harte trail. The trail is made of crushed limestone that is packed down. This creates a trail surface that is almost as good as pavement that you could ride a true road bike on if you wanted. It&#8217;s far smoother than most Manitoba highways, even the &#8220;good&#8221; ones.

The trail runs close to the Missouri, but the river isn&#8217;t always visible. The banks of the Missouri are naturally wooded given they provide a reliable source of water and there are no fires to control the tree growth. Much of the trail looks similar to this:

The trail was very busy out of St Charles with tourists and locals making day trips out of town. For the first 15 or 20 miles I was passing people every couple minutes. There are quite a few bridges along the route which provide a more open view of the landscape.

Occasionally the views open up and give a good view of the Missouri river.

The trail itself has trailheads every 10-20 miles with maps, washrooms, and sometimes bike tools and water. My first real stop was in Marthasville where they conveniently had a brew pub right next to the trail.

I had started with 3 liters of water in my Camelbak backpack, and given the temperatures were above 30C with high humidity I had nearly used all of my water by the time I biked the ~40 miles to Marthasville. The brewpub conveniently offered free water to refill my backpack, and I grabbed a stout and a sandwich for lunch. The problem with sitting around and having lunch with a beer is you tend to dehydrate pretty quickly in this climate. Lunch took longer than I would of liked due to the place being very busy, so 50 minutes later I was on my way.

A bit further down you could start to make out the bluffs along the river.

I wouldn&#8217;t say Missouri has mountains, but they do have some pretty decent looking hills.

I probably should have done a bit more research up front, but there was no water available between Marthasville and my destination for the day of Hermann. Even though I had 3 liters with me, I used on average 1 &#8211; 1.5L an hour in the heat. I ended up running out of water for about 15KM until I arrived at<span style="background-color: #d5d5d5;"> </span>McKittrick which is where I turned off the trail for the day. It should be obvious, but always have reserve water with you.

I ended off in Hermann for the day which had a nice downtown with some beautiful historic buildings.
